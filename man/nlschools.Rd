\title{
Eighth-Grade Pupils in the Netherlands
}
\description{
  Snijders and Bosker (1999) use as a running example a study of 2287
  eighth-grade pupils (aged about 11) in 132 classes in 131 schools in
  the Netherlands.  Only the variables used in our examples are supplied.

\format{
  This data frame contains 2287 rows and the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{lang}}{
      language test score.
    }
    \item{\code{IQ}}{
      verbal IQ.
    }
    \item{\code{class}}{
      class ID.
    }
    \item{\code{GS}}{
      class size: number of eighth-grade pupils recorded in the class (there
      may be others: see \code{COMB}, and some may have been omitted
      with missing values).
    }
    \item{\code{SES}}{
      social-economic status of pupil's family.
    }
    \item{\code{COMB}}{
      were the pupils taught in a multi-grade class (\code{0/1})?  Classes which
      contained pupils from grades 7 and 8 are coded \code{1}, but only
      eighth-graders were tested.
