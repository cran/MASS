\title{
  Ordered Logistic or Probit Regression
}
\description{
  Fits a logistic or probit regression model to an ordered factor
  response.  The default logistic case is \emph{proportional odds
    logistic regression}, after which the function is named.
}
\usage{
polr(formula, data, weights, start, \dots, subset, na.action,
     contrasts = NULL, Hess = FALSE, model = TRUE,
     method = c("logistic", "probit", "cloglog", "cauchit"))
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
  a formula expression as for regression models, of the form
  \code{response ~ predictors}. The response should be a factor
  (preferably an ordered factor), which will be interpreted as an
  ordinal response, with levels ordered as in the factor.  
  The model must have an intercept: attempts to remove one will
  lead to a warning and be ignored.  An offset may be used.  See the
  documentation of \code{\link{formula}} for other details.
}
\item{data}{
  an optional data frame in which to interpret the variables occurring
  in \code{formula}.
}
\item{weights}{
  optional case weights in fitting.  Default to 1.
}
\item{start}{
  initial values for the parameters.  This is in the format
  \code{c(coefficients, zeta)}: see the Values section.
}
\item{\dots}{
  additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{optim}}, most often a
  \code{control} argument.
}
\item{subset}{
  expression saying which subset of the rows of the data should  be used
  in the fit.  All observations are included by default.
}
\item{na.action}{
  a function to filter missing data.
}
\item{contrasts}{
  a list of contrasts to be used for some or all of
  the factors appearing as variables in the model formula.
}
\item{Hess}{
  logical for whether the Hessian (the observed information matrix)
  should be returned.  Use this if you intend to call \code{summary} or
  \code{vcov} on the fit.
}
\item{model}{
  logical for whether the model matrix should be returned.
}
\item{method}{
  logistic or probit or complementary log-log or cauchit (corresponding
  to a Cauchy latent variable).
}
}
\details{

  This model is what Agresti (2002) calls a \emph{cumulative link}
  model.  The basic interpretation is as a \emph{coarsened} version of a
  latent variable \eqn{Y_i} which has a logistic or normal or
  extreme-value or Cauchy distribution with scale parameter one and a
  linear model for the mean.  The ordered factor which is observed is
  which bin \eqn{Y_i} falls into with breakpoints
  \deqn{\zeta_0 = -\infty < \zeta_1 < \cdots < \zeta_K = \infty}{zeta_0 = -Inf < zeta_1 < \dots < zeta_K = Inf}
  This leads to the model
  \deqn{\mbox{logit} P(Y \le k | x) = \zeta_k - \eta}{logit P(Y <= k | x) = zeta_k - eta}
  with \emph{logit} replaced by \emph{probit} for a normal latent
  variable, and \eqn{\eta}{eta} being the linear predictor, a linear
  function of the explanatory variables (with no intercept).  Note
  that it is quite common for other software to use the opposite sign
  for \eqn{\eta}{eta} (and hence the coefficients \code{beta}).

  In the logistic case, the left-hand side of the last display is the
  log odds of category \eqn{k} or less, and since these are log odds
  which differ only by a constant for different \eqn{k}, the odds are
  proportional.  Hence the term \emph{proportional odds logistic
    regression}.

  In the complementary log-log case, we have a \emph{proportional
    hazards} model for grouped survival times.

  There are methods for the standard model-fitting functions, including
  \code{\link{predict}}, \code{\link{summary}}, \code{\link{vcov}},
  \code{\link{anova}}, \code{\link{model.frame}} and an
  \code{extractAIC} method for use with \code{\link{stepAIC}}.  There
  are also \code{\link{profile}} and \code{\link{confint}} methods.
